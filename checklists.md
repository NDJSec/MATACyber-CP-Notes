# Checklists (MATA Cyber CP)

## Note of Checklists
- A good checklist can help you know where to look and how to attack an image
- These checklists should not be static, they should ideally change each round as you find new information 

## Windows Checklists
- Your Windows checklist for some part can cover both the Windows Desktop and Server images
- One tailored to each is always a good idea

### What to put in your checklists
- Anything that can get you points
	- Places to look for things
	- Files to normally remove
	- Policies to set/check
	- Settings to change
	- Etc.
- This can be used in conjunction with scripts in order to set things such as security policies 

### MMC and CIS-CAT 
- The MMC (Microsoft Management Console) is a tool that allows you to easily set security policies and change settings all in one place
- The CIS-CAT tool is a compliance scanner that allows you to scan an image and create a checklist of things that you can change to harden the image
